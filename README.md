# 4-DOF-Robotic-Arm-ESP32-
A Wi-Fi controlled 4-DOF robotic arm built using servo motors and an ESP32. The system uses PWM-based servo control and an external regulated power supply for stable operation. Developed to explore embedded systems, robotic joint control, and basic kinematics through practical implementation.
